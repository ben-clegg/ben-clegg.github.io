<p>MutaGen is my experimental mutation testing tool.
Unlike conventional mutation tools, MutaGen implements mutation operators that specifically aim to simulate faults introduced by novice programmers, even if these faults are easy to detect.
As such, these mutants can be used to understand how a test suite assesses students' solution programs.</p>
