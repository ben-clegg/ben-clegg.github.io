An oilrig-themed map for TTT, a hidden identity gamemode for garrysmod.
With a broad variety of area in a relatively small environment, players are provided with many opportunties for frantic emergent gameplay, which the gamemode thrives on.

The map is featured in a video with over 380K views by a popular YouTube channel, and has around 32000 subscribers on the Steam Workshop.
