My undergraduate dissertation project, PiROMANCER, was a psuedo-modular synthesiser running on a Raspberry Pi 3.

The system is Linux based, with synthesis performed using Pyo, a Python audio library.
The Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins are used as input to determine signal routes, alongside "analog" input with the use of a DAC.
I designed and built the system, using the university's manufacturing facilities (such as laser cutting equipment).

For those interested in running Jack on a Raspberry Pi, the GitHub repository's README (alongside the full dissertation) provides some insight on some fixes for issues which may be encountered.
The repository also includes the system's code and design files, licensed under GPLv3.

(This dissertation project was supervised by Prof. Guy Brown at The University of Sheffield).
