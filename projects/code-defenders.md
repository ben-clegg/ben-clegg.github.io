I contributed to the Code Defenders project, by implementing a single-player mode, which allows for individuals to practice unit testing in a non-critical environment, with instantaneous feedback.
This involved integrating toolsets into a Tomcat web application. EvoSuite was used for automatic test suite generation, and Major for mutation testing.

My work was funded by The University of Sheffield's SURE Scheme, and supervised by Prof. Gordon Fraser and Dr. Jos√© Miguel Rojas.

(Note: Due to the high computational requirements of test suite generation, the single-player mode is currently disabled on the public-deployed version of Code Defenders.)
