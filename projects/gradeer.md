Gradeer is a modular assessment tool with support for both automated and manual assessment.
The tool allows tutors to run unit tests and static analysis tools on students' programs to automatically assess their code.
In addition, tutors can use manual checks to grade and write feedback for learning outcomes which are more difficult to assess automatically.
I have helped to deploy this tool in a series of programming assignments for an introductory Java programming module at the University of Sheffield.
