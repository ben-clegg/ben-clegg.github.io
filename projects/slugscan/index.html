<p>SLUGScan is a register system for fire-safety at society events.
Society members are given RFID cards, which are scanned by the system, updating a SQLite database which records their presence at events.</p>
<p>The system runs on a Raspberry Pi 3, and is housed in a 3D printed case, adapted from an open design.</p>
