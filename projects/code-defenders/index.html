<p>I contributed to the Code Defenders project, by implementing a single-player mode, which allows for individuals to practice unit testing in a non-critical environment, with instantaneous feedback.
This involved integrating toolsets into a Tomcat web application. EvoSuite was used for automatic test suite generation, and Major for mutation testing.</p>
<p>My work was funded by The University of Sheffield's SURE Scheme, and supervised by Prof. Gordon Fraser and Dr. Jos√© Miguel Rojas.</p>
<p>(Note: Due to the high computational requirements of test suite generation, the single-player mode is currently disabled on the public-deployed version of Code Defenders.)</p>
